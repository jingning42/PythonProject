## Introduction

This repository shows my code for the An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python course on Coursera provided by Rice University in 2014.

Following the course schedule, I have completed eight interactive applications in python in . Every application was a simple game. 

This is the first programming language course I took. I was very proud of my grade (Achieved: 97.5% with Distinction).

This is my [Statement of Accomplishment](https://github.com/jingning42/PythonProject/blob/master/Coursera_Certificate_v1-9720725747789.pdf)

### Course Link

The link to the course I took is no longer available. It seems like they break the course into two parts now. 

- [An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python (Part 1)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-1)

- [An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python (Part 2)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-2)

### How to play with these applications? 

You are welcome to play with my python applications by copying and pasting my code on [this website](www.codeskulptor.org).
